As the task is to create a series of markdown files for a GitHub repository, there are no shared dependencies in the traditional sense of software development (like exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, or function names). 

However, there are shared elements in terms of content and structure:

1. "Ableton" - The software used for producing electronic music, which is a common element in all the files.
2. "Stock Effects" - The built-in effects in Ableton used for sound design, mixing, and mastering.
3. "Sound Design", "Mixing", "Mastering" - These are the main processes involved in music production that will be documented across multiple files.
4. "Tips and Tricks" - This is a shared theme that can be incorporated into each of the process-specific files (Sound Design, Mixing, Mastering).
5. "Producer Thought Process" - This is another shared theme that can be incorporated into each of the process-specific files.
6. "Documentation Style" - The requirement to write in a conversational tone so that it resonates with the readers is a shared stylistic element across all files.
